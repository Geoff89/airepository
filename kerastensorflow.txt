#installing tensorflow and keras environment for deep learning

#installing miniconda for the basic 
1. Delete anaconda in the Users directory i.e contains the 
   python environment i.e C:/ Users/jeffnerd and delete Anaconda3
2. Go to environment in windows and remove python path and anaconda paths
   if previously installed   
3 go to miniconda site to install python

4. Go to anaconda site and download tne miniconda version of the anaconda
   It will contain python 3.7 by default.Choose 64 bit system
   Installing use the default settings
   Miniconda is in  downloads
   
5. After installing we need to set incompatibilty issues of python 3.7 and 3.6
   with tensorflow
   Create a tensorflow environment with python 3.6 not 3.7

 6. conda create --name tensorflow python=3.6
    activate tensorflow # activating the environment
	
 7 #Now install relevant packages in this environment
     conda install jupyter
     jupyter notebook

     #The following package are needed
     conda install scipy
     pip install --upgrade sklearn
	 pip install --upgrade pandas
	 pip install --upgrade pandas-datareader
	 pip install --upgrade matplotlib
	 pip install --upgrade pillow #directly manipulate images
	 pip install --upgrade requests
	 pip install --upgrade h5py  #keras stores files
	 pip install --upgrade psutil  #How our system is
	 pip install --upgrade tensorflow==1.12.0
	 pip install --upgrade keras==2.2.4
	 conda install statsmodels
	 
#To see if we installed successful
#in our tensorflow environment type -- 
   python
   import tensorflow as tf
   print(tf.__verson__)
   exit()
   
8  we want to make jupyter notebook aware of the environment we made
   ensure you are in te environment tensorflow
   
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name tensorflow --display-name "python 3.6 (tensorflow)"
   #run it so jupyter hub ensure us interact with the environment

9. cd to C:/ai
   enter dir  #gives you the files

10. type jupyter notebook
    #should list the files  present
11. Now the kernel are 3.7 and 3.6 select 3.6 kernel	
    Run the fucntions
